# User Management

A modular, secure, and scalable user management system built with **TypeScript**, **Express**, **Sequelize** (PostgreSQL), and **Redis**.  
This system provides APIs for registration, authentication, role management, password policies, email/OTP verification, and robust audit/compliance support.

## Key Features & Advantages

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  Modular structure for controllers, services, models, and utilities.

- **Strong Type Safety**  
  Written entirely in TypeScript with strict type-checking enabled.

- **Redis Integration**

  - Fast, in-memory session and authorization storage for authentication flows.
  - OTPs and tokens stored securely for time-limited access.
  - Enables horizontal scaling and distributed deployments.

- **Sequelize ORM**  
  For strong data modeling, migrations, and association management with PostgreSQL.

- **Secure Authentication**

  - JWT-based session handling.
  - Email/OTP-based verification for secure onboarding.
  - Password history and validation to prevent reuse.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  Assign and enforce user roles for fine-grained authorization.

- **API-Ready**  
  Well-defined RESTful endpoints and middleware for error handling and validation.

- **Extensible & Testable**  
  Clear module boundaries and single-responsibility design for easy extension and unit testing.

## Security & Best Practices

- Uses Redis for fast, in-memory, and time-limited storage of sensitive session and OTP data.
- Passwords are never stored in plain text (hashed and salted).
- Sensitive endpoints protected by JWT authentication middleware.
- All database models enforce strict validation and unique constraints.
- Modular design allows easy upgrades and integration with other services.

## Documentation & Conventions

- All classes, services, and controllers use [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) for inline documentation.
