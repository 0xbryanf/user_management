# User Management

A modular, secure, and scalable user management system built with **TypeScript**, **Express**, **Sequelize** (PostgreSQL), and **Redis**.  
This system provides APIs for registration, authentication, role management, password policies, email/OTP verification, and robust audit/compliance support.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices

This project follows best practices aligned with modern security standards and enterprise-grade architecture:

### üîê Token-Based Authentication with JWT

- Uses signed, stateless JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users.
- Middleware verifies tokens on every request to ensure user integrity.
- Tokens are encrypted and contain minimal, safe-to-expose data (e.g., `userId`, roles).

### ‚è±Ô∏è Redis-Based Session & Authorization Control

- Redis is used for storing time-limited session tokens, OTPs, and authorization payloads.
- Ensures secure and scalable short-lived access management.
- Supports use cases like passwordless auth, email confirmation, and OTP validation.

### üîê Password Security and Reuse Protection

- Passwords are hashed using `argon2`, designed to mitigate brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Historical password hashes are stored to **enforce password rotation policies**.
- Password change is tracked via metadata and can be audited for compliance.

### üß© Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Fine-grained control over features and resources through `Users`, `Roles`, and `UserRoles`.
- Each role can be assigned programmatically or via admin UI.
- Business logic can restrict access based on role context, allowing flexible permission mapping.

### üõ°Ô∏è Stateful Authorization Support (Admin-Controlled)

- While JWTs are stateless, **authorization metadata is stored in Redis**, allowing:
  - Real-time admin intervention to revoke, update, or flag user access.
  - Custom rules (e.g., geo-IP checks, behavioral flags) to deny or require extra validation.
  - Enforcement of temporary suspensions or escalated permissions (step-up authentication).

### üî≠ Threat Monitoring & Tamper Resistance

- All session and token-related events are auditable and expire predictably.
- Suspicious activity (e.g., reuse of expired tokens, OTP abuse) can trigger automatic revocation or alerts.
- Designed for integration with logging tools (e.g., Elastic, Loki, CloudWatch) and SIEM pipelines.

### üßº Input Validation & Type Safety

- Enforced via strict TypeScript configuration and runtime guards.
- Sequelize validation prevents invalid schema-level entries (e.g., email formats, unique constraints).

### üîê Middleware Guards

- Custom middleware prevents:
  - Unauthorized access
  - Double responses (using `responseGuardMiddleware`)
  - Missing headers or malformed payloads

### üõ†Ô∏è Secure CI/CD and Secrets Hygiene

- Secrets (e.g., JWT keys, Redis credentials) are managed via environment variables and `.env` files.
- Designed to be used in CI/CD pipelines with secret injection.
- No secrets are hardcoded or committed.

### üßæ Auditability & Compliance Support

- All critical models (Users, Credentials, Roles) include:
  - `created_by`, `updated_by`, and `deleted_by` fields for traceability.
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps to support forensic analysis.
- Ideal for regulated environments (HIPAA, SOC2, ISO 27001, etc.)

### üß† Optional: Step-Up Authentication / MFA (Extensible)

- Redis-backed state allows tracking of partial or escalated auth flows.
- Can be extended to support multi-step flows like MFA, biometric checks, or IP/device confirmation.

### ‚úÖ Enterprise Readiness

This project is **suitable for enterprise use**, featuring:

- **Stateless + Stateful Hybrid Design**  
  Allows scalability with Redis, while preserving administrative override and monitoring control.
- **Horizontal Scalability**  
  Compatible with container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) and serverless platforms.
- **Integrations**  
  Designed to integrate with identity providers (OAuth2, SAML, Azure AD, Okta).
- **High Security Posture**  
  Focused on identity assurance, tamper detection, and controlled authorization flows.
- **Flexible Extension Model**  
  Modular service/controller design allows seamless feature expansion with minimal risk.
